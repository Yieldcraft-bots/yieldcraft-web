YieldCraft Affiliate Program Terms (v${AFFILIATE_TERMS_VERSION})

Last updated: ${AFFILIATE_TERMS_VERSION}

IMPORTANT: This is a plain-English summary for clarity. The controlling terms are the full agreement provided during approval/onboarding. If there is any conflict, the signed agreement controls.

1) Who we are / what this is
YieldCraft (“YieldCraft”, “we”, “us”) offers a software subscription service. The Affiliate Program lets approved partners (“Affiliate”, “you”) refer customers to YieldCraft in exchange for commissions as defined below.

2) No employment / independent contractor
You are not an employee, agent, partner, or representative of YieldCraft. You have no authority to bind YieldCraft or make promises on our behalf. You are an independent contractor responsible for your own taxes, expenses, and compliance.

3) No financial advice / no performance promises (CRITICAL)
YieldCraft is software. You may NOT:
• promise or imply guaranteed profits, “risk-free” returns, or any specific performance (e.g., “10–30% monthly”)
• provide personalized investment advice, recommendations, or instructions to buy/sell specific assets
• market YieldCraft as a regulated broker/advisor, fund, or managed account
Allowed:
• explain what the software does in general terms
• share your personal experience as opinion (clearly labeled as opinion), without guarantees
Required language (use or similar):
• “YieldCraft is software. Trading involves risk. Results vary and are not guaranteed.”

4) Approved marketing only
You may promote YieldCraft using:
• your unique referral link and tracking tools we provide
• approved screenshots, descriptions, and marketing assets we publish
You may NOT:
• use misleading, deceptive, or aggressive “get rich quick” messaging
• impersonate YieldCraft, copy our website, or register confusingly similar domains/social handles
• use spam, automated DMs, scraped lists, robocalls, or unsolicited bulk email
• run ads bidding on “YieldCraft” trademarks/brand terms unless we explicitly approve in writing
• claim affiliation with Coinbase or any exchange beyond factual statements

5) Compliance with law & platforms
You must comply with:
• all applicable laws (including FTC endorsement/disclosure rules)
• platform policies (Google/Meta/X/YouTube/email providers, etc.)
You must clearly disclose you may earn a commission (examples):
• “I may earn a commission if you sign up through my link.”

6) Commission basics (high level)
Commission rates, eligibility windows, chargeback handling, and payout timing are defined in your Affiliate Dashboard and/or your signed agreement.
General principles:
• commissions are tied to successful, paid subscriptions attributed to your link
• refunds/chargebacks may reverse commissions
• we may delay payouts for fraud review or platform risk controls

7) Tracking, attribution, and fraud
We track attribution via links, cookies, and internal identifiers. You may NOT:
• self-refer (create accounts solely to earn commission) unless explicitly allowed
• use coupon “stacking” tricks, cookie stuffing, forced redirects, or misrepresentation
• incent with cash kickbacks unless we approve in writing
We may withhold or reverse commissions for suspected abuse or fraud.

8) Payouts
Payout method and schedule are defined by our payout processor (e.g., Stripe Connect) and/or your dashboard. You are responsible for keeping payout details accurate. YieldCraft is not responsible for banking delays or processor downtime.

9) Brand & content rules
You may use our brand assets only as provided. You may not edit logos in a way that confuses customers. You may not create content that is illegal, hateful, sexually explicit, or that violates others’ IP rights.

10) Termination
We may suspend or terminate the program, your account, or commissions at any time for violations, risk, compliance, fraud, or brand harm. You may stop participating at any time. Termination rules for final payouts are defined in your signed agreement.

11) Limitation of liability
YieldCraft is not liable for your marketing activities, claims you make, or damages arising from your promotion. You indemnify YieldCraft for claims caused by your violations, misrepresentations, or unlawful conduct.

12) Questions / reporting
If you see misleading claims or need clarification, contact support through the official channels listed on our site.

By participating, you agree to follow these rules and the signed agreement that governs the program.
